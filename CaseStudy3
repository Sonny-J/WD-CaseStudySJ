a. My website's goal is to make people listen to various kinds of music using my website.

b. Target audience would be anyone who enjoys listening to music. As they want simple and clear-organized website that can verify their taste of music 
and songs in my website should be appropriate to the genre of its category, I need to read the trend flow of music nowadays. and make my website's base color purple so they can 
feel comfortable and generate the mood to listen to music.

c. Home page, and 4 other pages that categorize their music genres(Each of them is seperated into playlists which their genre shows), feedback page made for users to give 
feedbacks, song request page that users can pick and put into the playlists, and random playlist radio station page opened 24/7.
So it would be 17 pages total. and all pages should be able to go back to homepage.

d. The thing that my website is different with any other musical website is having an adding songs request page. Users can literally make their playlists with 
ohers by using my website.
To avoid the copyright problems in my website(since I use other people's music), I will put every source in every music by showing youtube links or soundcloud links that
shows where all the music came from. My website is not for gaining profits or any money.

e. My website's structure would be hierarchical & webbed website structure.
