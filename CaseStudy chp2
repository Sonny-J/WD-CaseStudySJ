What type of things do I need in my First page(Hompage, Landpage)of my website:
1. Homepage( Lists the categories of music playlists) 2. Secondary pages when I click at the first page (Subsidiary pages) 
1. Hompage 
Should include images, text, audio, and some videos.
I need images that show my webiste is a music website. ( like pictures of headphones, mp3 player) This would go on first pages to get visitors' attentions with images.
Logo would be purple color with these images and It should go to the homepage whenever I click the logo at Subsidiary pages or Landing pages.
Categories in homepage must have different color in each of them. It could be rainbow colors.
Subsidiary pages should share the same main color of the homepage(which is purple). 
It's from Landing page so It should have the same color of the category I've chosen.
The connectivity tool I'll use will be Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer.
I'll promote interactivity by making a little community that people in the site could chat and hang out with each others.
"Eat music like food, by your taste">>would be my site's tag line.
Purple would be the color of the logo <SonnyPop>, and the main & subsidiary pages' base color.
I will use the RWD principles(Focus on screens, not on device) to enhance my website's usability.
I'll use the appropriate color that can get visitors'attentions and create the mood of my website, and the familiar font will be used for the same reason as the color.
