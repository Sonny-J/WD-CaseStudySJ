What type of things do I need in my First page(Hompage, Landpage)of my website:
1. Homepage( Lists the categories of music playlists) 2. Secondary pages when I click at the first page (Subsidiary pages) 
1. Hompage 
Should include images, text, audio, and some videos.
I need images that show my webiste is a music website. ( like pictures of headphones, mp3 player) This would go on first pages to get visitors' attentions with images.
Logo would be purple color with these images and It should go to the homepage whenever I click the logo at Subsidiary pages or Landing pages.
Categories in homepage must have different color in each of them. It could be rainbow colors.
Subsidiary pages should share the same main color of the homepage(which is purple). 
It's from Landing page so It should have the same color of the category I've chosen.
